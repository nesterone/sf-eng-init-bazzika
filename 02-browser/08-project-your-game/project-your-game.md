### Intro

The idea is simple, start your own simple game project directly in that folder.
Pick game from the list below

List of games:

1. [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_\(video_game\))
1. [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_\(video_game\))
1. [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)
1. [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)
1. [Space Inviders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)

### Requirements

1. Your implementation shouldn't cover all features of original, concentrate on few
1. Think about work which have to be done
    * split your work into issues with label `project`
    * estimate
    * review with mentor
1. Prefer HTML/CSS instead of Canvas, you may extend project later as a bonus task
    
#### Hints

* design gameplay (score, hints, etc)
* fill README.md with appropriate info, it`s very important part of the project 
* game should be enjoyable ;-)
