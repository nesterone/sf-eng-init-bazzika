### Theory

#### Planning

1. Before planning, trainees should create their issues according to `Issues Guide`
1. During planing team discus issues, corner cases and prepare plan for next iteration

##### Issues Guide

1. Provide meaningful, descriptive  name for the issue
    * NO any 'Exercise 1' or 'My article'
1. Issue shouldn't have empty description, at least link to the 'source' of the issue
    * usually 'sources' of the issue somewhere in our content, for example you always can make a link to any exercise or theory subsection
    * put whatever useful information you may found to solve the issue
1. Provide proper `label` for the issue
1. Provide proper `milestone`, usually they like `trainee-bootcamp`, `trainee-syntax` etc
1. Provide your `estimation` in some imaginary points, I call them `elephants`
1. Don't hesitate to start discussion in comments section
    * for example it could be a question to mentor or some information to yourself

###### Labels
 
| Label         | Description    |
| --------------|:-------------:|
| `theory`      | Some media content which you have to read, watch or listen, usually they are items from `Theory` or `Addition` section |
| `exercise`    | Any exercise from `Practice` section |
| `workshop`    | Any cource or workshop which involves not only `passive consuming of information` but some actions from your side, like replicating of some actions. For example NodeSchool workshops|
| `question`    | Questions for some topic|
| `project`     | It's a special type of `Practise`, when you have to plan your project and split it into small sub-tasks|
| `bug`         | Defects in your exercise or project|
| `tech-dept`   | Bad design, `code smells` in your project|
| `setup`       | Installation or configuration of some software, tool etc|
| `challenge`       | Usually not simple task, require additional afford to complete|


###### Estimation

>My subjective recommendations

| Points         | Description    |
| --------------|:-------------:|
| 1     | Something trivial, it could takes you around one hour to make it done|
| 2     | Still clear what and how to do, may take from 1-2h to make it done|
| 3     | There are some minor unknown parts, you have to make some steps in learn/investigate things, it may takes you from 1-3h to make it done|
| 5     | Looks like investigation can take almost half of the time, you may spend around 4h to make it done|
| 8     | 2/3 of `you don't know`, it can takes you around 6h to make it done|
| 13    | You have a clue on how to make it, but tasks seems challenging for you, it can takes whole day to make it done|
| 20    | It's a real challenge for you,  so you are a bit scared by complexity of the task, however you desire to make it done, it can takes from one to three days of your time|
| 40    | `Terra incognito`, no lees then month of work|
| 100   | You are paralyzed by complexity of the task, you feel like it would takes years to make it done|

#### Time Management

1. Each task has to be presented in our issue tracker
1. Task has to be like "Do something in 5 hours" but not "Do something" (keep hours in your mind) in tracker use points
1. Don't spend more time on the task then it requires
1. Try to complete as much tasks as possible
1. Write all completed actions and occurred problems. It would be ground for increasing time limit for the task
1. Absence of time isn't a reason in cases like: "I was working on task A that's why haven't done task B". Exceptions are 
    * dependent tasks, when incomplete A is a blocker for B. 
1. Try to work evenly. For example you have a task for 6 hour but delivery is in 3 days, it's ok to split for 2 hours per day. Work on few tasks simultaneously each day by combining complex and easy tasks
1. Lear to effectively use time-frames for performing small sub-tasks. For example
    * build of the project
    * execution of tests
    * docs/email
1. If you have done all urgent and important tasks for current iteration, take a look in future materials and try to prepare sketch plan for it, then go back for learned section and read additional materials like articles,books or bonus tasks.

### Practice

#### Exercise 1 

Prepare for next planning. Make sure that you cover all topics and 
assign proper labels and milestones. Don't forget about estimates. Prepare questions about exercises if any etc
