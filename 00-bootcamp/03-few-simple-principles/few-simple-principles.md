### Theory

#### Casual Programming

##### Entry Barriers to Development

Another important dimension along which operating systems differ is the height of the barrier that separates mere users from becoming developers. There are two important cost drivers here. One is the monetary cost of development tools, the other is the time cost of gaining proficiency as a developer. Some development cultures evolve social barriers to entry, but these are usually an effect of the underlying technology costs, not a primary cause.

Expensive development tools and complex, opaque APIs produce small and elitist programming cultures. In those cultures, programming projects are large, serious endeavors — they have to be in order to offer a payoff that justifies the cost of both hard and soft (human) capital invested. Large, serious projects tend to produce large, serious programs (and, far too often, large expensive failures).

Inexpensive tools and simple interfaces support casual programming, hobbyist cultures, and exploration. Programming projects can be small (often, formal project structure is plain unnecessary), and failure is not a catastrophe. This changes the style in which people develop code; among other things, they show less tendency to over-commit to failed approaches.

Casual programming tends to produce lots of small programs and a self-reinforcing, expanding community of knowledge. In a world of cheap hardware, the presence or absence of such a community is an increasingly important factor in whether an operating system is long-term viable at all.

1. [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
    * [Unix: Rule of Simplicity](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2877917)
1. [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
    * [YouArentGonnaNeedIt](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt)

### Practice

#### Workshop: JavaScript for Cats

Let's make a bit of casual programming with next cool workshop [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/)

#### Workshop: Discover Developer Tools

* [Chapter 1: Getting Started & Basic DOM and Styles](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/1?locale=en)
* [Chapter 2: Advanced DOM and Styles](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/2?locale=en)
* [Chapter 3: Working With the Console](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/3?locale=en)
* [Chapter 4: Debugging JavaScript](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/4?locale=en)
* [Chapter 5: Network](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/5?locale=en)
* [Chapter 6: Profiles](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/6?locale=en)
* [Chapter 7: Memory](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/7?locale=en)

#### Exercise: Overview of DRY,KISS and YAGNI

Write expanded overview of how DRY, KISS and YAGNI principles connected together

#### Exercise: Overengineering and Imagination

Provide 5 imaginary or real examples of `Overengineering`, for example

* family sedan that can drive at 300 km/h
* home video cassette recorder with a projected lifespan of 100 years
