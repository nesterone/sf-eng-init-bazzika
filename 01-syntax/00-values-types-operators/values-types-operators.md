#Basic Syntax

**[<= Back](../bootcamp/tools-for-development.md)**		*	*	*	**[Next =>](functions-and-data-structures.md)**

So, during bootcamp you have to work with javascript even without deep understanding
it's parts. Right now it's time to start learn it in details.

The backbone of this course is [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) written by Marijn Haverbeke. It's not only 'book' but a sandbox for playing with code

Separation between theory and practice very subjective here. You have to understand
each sample in provided book, change, play with code. If you can't
understand some tasks/samples send a link to the chat with question.

>Hint: Each section in the book has anchor like [this](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html#p_hkFlscMSbe) or [that](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html#c_MhQVBHC9xI)
